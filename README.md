HaxeScript
==========

This project was created with the need for using a scripting language in Unity.
Currently only compiles to CS but plan to add support for other languages.

I did not create the scripter, i merely created an object for ease of use. The scripting repo is here: https://github.com/clemos/hscript

Build out the DLL with the bat files for your relevant needs.

Unity - Must have Unity installed and have set environment path to the correct bin folder (mine is: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Mono\bin')
