HaxeScript
==========

This project was created with the need for using a scripting language in Unity.
Currently only compiles to CS but plan to add support for other languages.

Build out the DLL with the bat files for your relevant needs.

I did not create the scripter, i merely created an object for ease of use. The scripting repo is here: https://github.com/clemos/hscript
